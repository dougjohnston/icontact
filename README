iContact
========
iContact is an email marketing service provider, and this is a Rails plugin to
interface with their REST/XML api. The api is in beta and doesn't look to have
a particularly large amount of development going on, but it is fairly complete
and looks to cover most functionality.

For now I'm just producing a plugin, I'll move it over to a gem when it's more
complete.
